# JavaScript

### Characteristics of JavaScript

- `Multi-Paradigm`: supports object-oriented, declarative (functional) and imperative programming styles.
- `Prototype-based`: classes are not explicitly defined, they're derived by adding properties and methods to an instance of another class or adding them to an empty object.
- `Dynamic typing`: the interpreter assigns variable a type based on the variable's value an runtime.
- `First-class functions`: this means that functions can be treated as variables, they (functions) can be assigned to variables or passed as arguments to other functions.
