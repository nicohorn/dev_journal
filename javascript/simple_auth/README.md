## Auth demo

### JWT with HTTP-only Refresh Token Cookie Demo

In this simple demo, I'm using refresh and access tokens for authentication.
The idea here is to demonstrate how they're used with a simple approach.

Made using Express, vanilla JavaScript (along with HTML and inline CSS) and very few libraries:
jwt, cookieParser and path.
